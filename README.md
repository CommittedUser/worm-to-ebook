### worm-epub

This is a simple python script for scraping the webserial Worm for a ebook copy. The script copies and formats the individual pages into a directory, and creates a basic table of contents. The resulting directory of html files can be converted into epub or mobi formats using a single [Calibre command](http://calibre-ebook.com/), for which the table of contents file is necessary.

####Credits

The scraping is based on [rdeits/WPepub](https://github.com/rdeits/WPepub), which for some reason I could not use to complete the ebook as-is.
